Once upon a time,

A farmer saw bright lights coming from her corn field.  She thought she heard strange noises too but couldn't be sure.  When she went to investigate, she found what looked like alien markings. As she began to look over the markings, a bright flash of light covered the area around her. She started to scream, but it was cut short as she was lifted into the air. She looked up to see the enormous shape she was being dragged into. 

The end.
